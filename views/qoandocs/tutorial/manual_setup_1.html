<h3>Step 1: Filesystem Setup</h3>

<p><b>Application Directory</b>.  To set up a Qoan application, you will first need a directory.  Create one called "qoandocs".

<div class="code">
mkdir qoandocs
</div>

<p><b>Application Script File</b>.  Inside that directory, create a Perl code file.  It can be called whatever you want.  Let's call it "qoandocs.cgi".

<div class="code">
touch qoandocs/qoandocs.cgi
</div>

<p>Note that Qoan does not care what the file extension is of your script file.  You can call it "qoandocs.pl" if you want; the only thing that matters is that you get Perl to execute the file.

<p><b>Views Directory</b>.  Again inside your new directory, create another directory called "views".

<div class="code">
mkdir qoandocs/views
</div>

<p>You have now performed the absolute bare essentials filesystem setup for a Qoan application.
