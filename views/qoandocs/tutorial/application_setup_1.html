<h3>Step 1: Application quick set-up</h3>

<p>
(If you haven't yet, go through the <a href="/qoandocs/tutorial?name=qoan_setup">Basic Set-up Tutorial</a>.  It's short!  And this will still be here!)

<p>
0. Create a directory in your Qoan applications home directory.  Call it "helloworld" if you're not feeling inspired just now.

<p>
1. Copy the contents under the path <b>utility/setup_app</b> in your Qoan installation folder to your new application directory.  This includes 3 files (<b>.htaccess</b>, <b>app.config</b>, and <b>app.pl</b>) and 2 directories (<b>views</b> and <b>Qoan</b>).

<p>
2. Open the <b>app.pl</b> file.  In the line

<div class="code">
use lib qw| /path/to/qoan |;
</div>

<p>replace the "/path/to/qoan" segment with the absolute path to your Qoan installation's <b>parent</b> directory.  (This will be your Qoan applications home directory, unless you have split the two.)  If your Qoan installation is already in your Perl library search path, you can <b>delete</b> this line.

<p>
3. Open your <b>.qoan_applications</b> file (in the web server's public area) and add the following line:

<div class="code">
hello_sailor = helloworld/app
</div>

<p>
4. Visit this URL in your browser: <b>http://[your domain]/hello_sailor</b>.
<br />What do you see?

<p>
<b>I see a page that says "Hello, World."</b>

<p>
That's what you want!  For kicks, visit this URL: <b>http://[your domain]/hello_sailor?debug=http</b>.
<br />What do you see?

<p>
<b>I see some kind of report saying a lot of stuff I don't understand.</b><br />
That's the debug report.  You set up the new app correctly!  Hurray!

<p>
Of course, you have only set up the most basic functionality here.  To create a real application, you'll have to add code.  For now, though, let's see an explation of what you've done and some alternate base configurations.
