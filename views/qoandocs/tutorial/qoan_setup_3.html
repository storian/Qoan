<h3>Step 3: Alternate set-ups</h3>

<p>
<b>I want to install Qoan under my webserver's public document root.</b><br />
This will not break anything.  However, make sure that your web server is configured not to serve up any of Qoan's files.

<p>
<b>I want to install Qoan with my system's other Perl modules.</b><br />
This too will not break anything.  However, Qoan contains a lot of non-code resources, which Qoan shares between all your Qoan applications, and which are intended for you to add to or change.  This being the case, it may not be policy-appropriate on your system to install Qoan with static code libraries.

<p>
<b>I want to install Qoan's code with my Perl modules and the other stuff somewhere else.</b><br />
That's fine; however, Qoan will no longer know by default where to find these resources.  If you don't want to use them, then it's no big deal.  If you do, you will have to configure your Qoan applications to supply this information to Qoan.

<p>
<b>I don't want to install Qoan with my Qoan applications.</b><br />
You can keep Qoan and your Qoan applications in separate directories.  This arrangment will break one thing in Qoan: its internal applications (which includes its documentation).  If you don't want to use them, then this is another example of no big deal.  If you do, you can make them available by adding a line for <b>apps_home</b> and setting it to the <i>absolute</i> path to your Qoan applications directory.

<p>
<b>I don't want to use one Qoan applications directory.</b><br />
Radical, dude.  See the next tutorial for the answer to this.

<p>
<b>I want to put my Qoan apps under the web server's public area.</b><br />
You can do that.  There is information on that in the next tutorial.

<p>
<b>I don't want to put the redirection components in the same directory.</b><br />
And you don't have to!  Except for the .htaccess files.  Those absolutely must go into the redirection directory, because they are the first point of telling Apache what you want it to do.  More info on that in the next tutorial.

<p>
<b>I don't want to do this redirection baloney at all.</b><br />
The best Qoan can do is to let you run an app directly from the web server's public area (again, see the next tutorial).  However, even this requires some web server redirection.  It does allow you to dispense with the default redirection apparatus, if that appeals to you.  Again, Qoan is designed not to use literal resource paths.  Even if you set up a Qoan application to use paths which are <i>reeeal</i> close to the actual paths of the resources it will dish up, they still will not be literal paths.

<p>
<b>I want to rename stuff.</b><br />
<ul>
<li>Renaming .htaccess files means Apache will not find them, which will break the redirection chain.
<li>Renaming the Qoan installation directory will break Qoan, as all its libraries are identified with the name "Qoan".
<li>Renaming qoan_redirect.cfg means you will have to edit qoan_redirect.cgi, as it expects that name.
<li>Renaming qoan_redirect.cgi means you will have to edit your .htaccess files, as they expect that name.
</ul>

<p>
Those are the options for overall Qoan setup.  Now we move on to setting up a Qoan application.
