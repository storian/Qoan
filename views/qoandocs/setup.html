<h2>Installation and App Set-up Overview</h2>

<h3>How Qoan Works</h3>

<p>
Qoan works by redirection.  Web requests are not directly made to a core Qoan file, or a Qoan application script, that you might store somewhere in your web server's public directory.  Qoan provides a redirection apparatus, consisting of a few files (3 at this time), which guides an HTTP request to your Qoan application.  Everything in this overview follows from that.

<h3>Where to install Qoan itself?</h3>

<p>
<b>1. Qoan doesn't expect to be public.</b><br />
Qoan is designed to work only with "virtual" request URLs; so there is no need for Qoan to be under your web server's public document root, where Jane Q. Public might accidentally read it.

<p>
<b>2. Qoan apps do not expect Qoan to be in your system's Perl library path.</b><br />
Qoan's redirection apparatus includes the path to Qoan in its calls to your application scripts; so there is no need to make sure Qoan lives somewhere on your system's Perl library path.

<p>
Note that neither of these is a requirement.  The default recommendation is to install Qoan into an appropriate directory near your web server's document root.  See the <a href="tutorial?name=qoan_setup">Qoan installation tutorial</a> for installation directions and options.

<h3>Where to install my Qoan apps?</h3>

<p>
<b>1. Qoan apps don't need to be public.</b><br />
Qoan's redirection files are the only ones which must be where your web server can read them.  This means that your Qoan application resources proper can reside outside of your web server's public area, just like Qoan itself.

<p>
<b>2. Qoan does not care where your Qoan apps are.</b><br />
A Qoan app consists, at bottom, of a script file.  This script uses the Qoan library to do its work.  Qoan makes no assumption about where your script lives, or anything else "external" in that way.  Qoan does assume that your app script and certain basic private resources all live in one directory.

<p>
Again, these are not requirements.  The default recommendation here is to use the same directory in which you installed Qoan for your Qoan application directories.  See the <a href="tutorial?name=application_setup">Qoan application installation tutorial</a> for application set-up directions and options.
